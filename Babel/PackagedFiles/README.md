# Babel Programming Language

Babel is inspired by the story of the Tower of Babel in the Bible, and [APL (A Programming Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)).

The idea behind the language is that it should mostly look like average code, but with every keyword being in a different language, and every control and operator character different from the standard characters used in most programming languages.

## Example Program
```
funkcjonować ⟅⟆ 主要的꧁
  x ≔ 1 ⊕ 1~
  y ≔ 2 ⊖ 1~
  əgər⟅x ≺ y⟆꧁
    tisk⟅x⟆~
  ꧂
  それ以外꧁
    tisk⟅y⟆~
  ꧂
꧂
```
This prints `2` if `x < y`, otherwise prints `1`.

## Example
The above example is included in the Examples folder as example.bbl. To build and run the example, use `./babel Examples/example.bbl` for linux, or `./babel.exe Examples/example.bbl` for windows.

## Compiling Babel Programs

The Babel compiler is a command-line tool. Source files must use the `.bbl` extension to be recognized as valid Babel programs. Babel binaries are compatible with `lldb` for debugging.

**Usage:**

Linux / macOS:
```bash
./babel  [OPTIONS]
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\babel.exe  [OPTIONS]
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<file>.bbl` | Input source file (required, must have `.bbl` extension) |
| `-c` | Output to object file instead of executable |
| `-o <filename>` | Set the output filename |
| `-target <triple>` / `--target=<triple>` | Select an alternate build target |
| `-sysroot <path>` / `--sysroot=<path>` | Provide an alternate sysroot |

## Cross Compiling
Babel can be cross compiled between Linux x86, Linux ARM64, and Windows x86. The build for each platform is bundled with Clang and LLD, as well as the required sysroots to facilitate cross compliation. If you wish, a different sysroot can be passed in via the `--sysroot=` options, as long as it matches the given `--target=`. Babel supports  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`,`x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `x86_64-w64-windows-gnu`.
Note: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`will resolve to `x86_64-w64-windows-gnu` as the bundled toolchain uses clang instead of mingw.

Linux / macOS:
```bash
./babel program.bbl --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\babel.exe program.bbl --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

## Syntax

### Statements

Each statement must end with `~`.
```
x ≔ 1 ⊕ 1~
```

### Functions

Functions are declared in the format `function (args) FunctionName {}`. Arguments are separated by `᨞`.
 The main function **must** be named `主要的`. 

**Main function declaration:**
```
funkcjonować ⟅⟆ 主要的꧁
...
꧂
```

**Custom function declaration:**
```
funkcjonować ⟅arg1 ᨞ arg2⟆ functionName꧁
...
꧂
```

### Assignment

Only integers are supported. Results of arithmetic can be used, but not comparisons.  Assignment uses `≔`:
`x ≔ 42~`
`x ≔ 1 ⊕ 1~`
`z ≔ x ⊕ y~`

### If / Else

```
əgər⟅x ≺ y⟆꧁
꧂
それ以外꧁
꧂
```

### Print

`tisk` writes the variable or value to the standard output:
```
tisk⟅x⟆~
```

### Comments
Comments are single lines beginning with `✎`
```
✎ This is a comment
```

> **Note:** Loops and return values are not yet defined.
